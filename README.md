This project is a computer vision library built on top of ndarray. This project
is a work in progress. It is possible to load an image apply filters and save
it back, however it is currently largely non-functional.

# Features

* RGB and HSV conversions
* Image convolutions and some filters (box linear, gaussian)
* Encoding and decoding PPM (binary or plaintext)
